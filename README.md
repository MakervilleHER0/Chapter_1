# Chapter_1

# Here are the scripts needed to create a Face Recognition system. You'll need the following files in a single folder: 
# - FaceRecognition.py, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, and photos of the people you want to recognize.
# You will also need to change the code to rename the photos to match the names of your photos.
# You can increase or decrease the number of photos (currently I use 7 photos). Just be consistant. 

# If the code isn't working, please watch my Youtube video to understand how to make the code work

# Dependancies: You will need Visual Studio 2017 (v15.9), Python 3.3.6, openCV v3.4.10, and face_recognition 1.2.3
